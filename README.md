# Assessment 4
# MetaCrafters ATM
* This project implements a decentralized application (DApp) for an ATM using Ethereum's blockchain and MetaMask. The DApp allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, view their account balance, deposit and withdraw ETH, and double their balance through a smart contract.

## It includes the 4 main codes of the assessment.
* index.js = the frontend of the program
* deploy.js = main function of the program
* Assessment.sol = the contract of the program
* Assessment.json = the ABI of the program

## Prerequisites
* Before running this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
* Node.js and npm installed
* MetaMask browser extension installed
* Hardhat Ethereum development environment

## Smart Contract
* The smart contract, written in Solidity, is responsible for managing user balances and transactions. It includes functions for depositing, withdrawing, and doubling the balance. The smart contract is deployed using Hardhat.

### Smart Contract Functions
#### constructor(uint initBalance)
* Description: The constructor function initializes the contract with an initial balance set by the deployer.
* Parameters: initBalance (uint256): Initial balance for the contract.
* Visibility: Public
State Mutability: Payable
#### getBalance()
* Description: Returns the current balance of the contract.
* Returns: uint256: Current balance of the contract.
* Visibility: Public
* State Mutability: View
### deposit(uint256 _amount)
* Description: Allows the contract owner to deposit ETH into the contract.
* Parameters: _amount (uint256): Amount of ETH to deposit.
* Visibility: Public

### withdraw(uint256 _withdrawAmount)
* Description: Allows the contract owner to withdraw a specified amount of ETH from the contract.
* Parameters: _withdrawAmount (uint256): Amount of ETH to withdraw.
* Visibility: Public
* State Mutability: Non-Payable
### doubleBalance(uint256 _doubleamount)
* Description: Allows the contract owner to double the balance of the contract by a specified factor.
* Parameters: _doubleamount (uint256): Factor to double the balance by.
* Visibility: Public
